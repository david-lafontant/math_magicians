"Math magicians" is a website for all fans of mathematics. It is a Single Page App (SPA) that allows users to:

Make simple calculations.
Read a random math-related quote.

## Set up
This is the first project of the Math Magicians application. I set up the environment and tools needed to develop a React application. 

## Built With
### Major languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Technologies used:
- npm
- React
- Webpack
Learning objectives
Set up a React app.
Use React documentation.
Live Demo
Live Demo Link

## Getting Started
In order to see the project in your browser you must click on the link "Live Demo"

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

### Prerequisites
If they are not installed download and install: Node, Git and and code editor. Then 

- Clone the repository by typing this in your terminal  `git clone 

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
